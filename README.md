# Uniform Luminosity Palette Generator

Some tests to get a SCSS function that, given a (hue, sat, lum) can generate a color, not based on the light of the hsl, but based on the perceived light.
For example, 2 color tones, blue <span style="background-color:#00f;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> and yellow <span style="background-color:#ff0;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>, have the same light value (50%) but a drastic difference of emitted light.
