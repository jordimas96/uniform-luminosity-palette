# Uniform Luminosity Palette Generator

Some tests to get a SCSS function that, given a (hue, sat, lum) can generate a color, not based on the light of the hsl, but based on the perceived light.
For example, 2 color tones, blue ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/12x12/00f/00f.png) and yellow ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/12x12/ff0/ff0.png), have the same light value (50%) but a drastic difference of emitted light.
